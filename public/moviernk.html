<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>
This is probably my favourite movie of all time. I love EVERYTHING about Coraline. The characters, the ambience, the color 
pallete, the soundtrack, the animations, the delicate creepyness. A masterpiece.

<h3>Blade Runner 2049</h3>
<p>
I actually haven't watched this one yet!! LMAO. But i still love it.

<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>
I have a tattoo of this one. Studio Ghibli animations are insanely mezmerizing.
